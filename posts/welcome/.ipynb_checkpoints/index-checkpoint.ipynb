    "I appreciate you taking the time to click and read. I have plans to use this platform as a place to help anyone out there that, like myself, has not had the best experience with formal education but has a thirst and a passion for learning. I intend to cover my own projects, the successes and the pitfalls, but also community resources, focusing on free and open source, as well as troubleshooting and technical learning I have done in building my own system at home for training models and building apps.\n",

I am truly excited to be able to live in a time when the development of something as powerful and interesting as AI is current and so as-of-yet undiscovered, it really feels like this is just the beginning for this technology and I cannot wait to see where it goes.\n"
